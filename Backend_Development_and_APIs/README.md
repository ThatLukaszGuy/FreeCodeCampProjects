It's just all the projects needed to pass the automated checks. They're not pretty or well designed in the slightest, they just exist to pass the tests. You can either use the codepen links or look at files here, both are identical. However there is a prettier/improved version that I made (those however dont fully meet the test) on: [Nodemagic](https://nodemagic.herokuapp.com/fcc)
