# FreeCodeCampProjects

Ready Solutions needed for freecodecamp certificates. This repo doesn't contain every possible solution since I did not take all of the available courses.

## Available - Partially or Fully

- Legacy Web Design
- JavaScript algorithms and data structures
- Backend API's
- Python
  - Scientific Computing
  - Data Analysis
  - Machine Learning
- Rest - sometime in the future

## Note

This repo will be randomly updated and has no higher priority for me.

## Certificates

For links to my certificates look in the Certifications.md file.
